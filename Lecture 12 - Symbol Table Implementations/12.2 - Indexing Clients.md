# 12.2 - Indexing Clients

Another common function that's easily handled by symbol tables is indexing. We'll look at a client that achieves that here.

There're a lot of situations we encounter where we have a lot of information present, and we want to find a way to index that information so that we can provide a search key and get all the associated information. Searching for files on a computer is one classic such case. We'll look at that case a little more closely now.

## File Indexing

Our goal is:

> Given a list of files specified, create an index so that you can efficiently find all files containing a given query string.
 
So for example, if our program was called `FileIndex`, then the program in action might look like:

```
% ls *.txt
aesop.txt magna.txt moby.txt sawyer.txt tale.txt

% java FileIndex *.txt 

freedom
magna.txt moby.txt tale.txt

whale
moby.txt

lamb
sawyer.txt aesop.txt
```

A programmer could use the same program to look for files where he's used specific terms. For instance:

```
% ls *.java
BlackList.java Concordance.java DeDup.java FileIndex.java ST.java Set.java Whitelist.java

% java FileIndex *.java

import
FileIndex.java Set.java ST.java

Comparator
null
```

### Implementation

How do we do this? The solution is to use a Symbol Table where:
* Key is the query string
* Value is the `Set` of files containing that string.

In code, that looks like:

```Java
import java.io.File;

public class FileIndex {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    ST<String, Set<File>> st = new ST<String, Set<File>>();
    
    for (String filename: args) {
      File file = new File(filename);
      In in = new In(file);
      while (!in.isEmpty()) {
        String key = in.readString();
        
        if (!st.contains(key))
          st.put(key, new Set<File());
        
        Set<File> set = st.get(key);
        set.add(file);
      }
    }
    
    while (!StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String query = StdIn.readString();
      StdOut.println(st.get(query));
    }
  }
}
```

## Concordance

Another, related use of an indexing client is to preprocess text to support what're known as concordance queries, which can be defined as:

> Given a word, find all occurrences with their immediate context.
 
In action, that looks like:

```
% java Concordance tale.txt
cities
tongues of the two *cities* that were blended in

majesty
their tunrkeys and the *majesty* of the law fired
me treason afainst the *majesty* of the people in
of his most gracious *majesty* king george the third

princeton
no matches
```

We're very familiar with that given this is how web searches surface results.

### Implementation

Again, using symbol tables its possible to write a program to support concordance relatively easily:

```Java
public class Concordance {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // Set up variables
    In in = new In(args[0]);
    String[] words = StdIn.readAll().split("\\s+");
    ST<String, Set<Integer>> st = new ST<String, Set<Integer>>();
    
    // Populate the symbol table
    for (int i = 0; i< words.length; i++) {
      String s = words[i];
      if (!st.contains(s))
        st.put(s, new Set<Integer>());
      
      Set<Integer> pages = st.get(s);
      set.put(i);
    }
    
    // Process queries
    while(StdIn.isEmpty()) {
      String query = StdIn.readString();
      Set<Integer> set = st.get(query);
      for (int k: set)
        // print words[k-4] to words[k+4]
    }
  }
}
```
