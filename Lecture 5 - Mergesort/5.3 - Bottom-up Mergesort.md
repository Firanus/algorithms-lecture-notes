# 5.3 - Bottom-up Mergesort

While mergesort is perhaps most easily understood as a recusive algorithm, there is also a bottom-up version of it that is both relatively easy to understand and to code.

## Algorithm

The basic permise of the algorithm is to pass through the array merging subarrays of size 1. You then repeat for subarrays of size 2, 4, 8, 16, etc...

The main difference here is the lack of recursion (which has advantages in terms of limiting the size of your callstack while the sort is in progress).

The code is:

```Java
public class MergeBU {
  public static Comparable[] aux;
  
  public static void sort(Comparable[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    
    aux = new Comparable[N];
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) aux[j] = a[j];
    
    
    for (int size = 1; size < N; size *= 2) {
      for (int lo = 0; lo < N - size; lo += size + size)
        merge(a, lo, lo+sz-1, Math.min(lo+sz+sz-1, N-1));
      }
    }
  }
  
  private static void merge(Comparable[] a, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
    /*As before*/
  }
}
```

This is concise, industrial strength code. The only downside is, as with regular mergesort, you need N additional space.

In Swift, this looks like (using the same merge operation as before):

```Swift
func bottomUpMergeSorted() -> Array {
    var elements = self

    var size = 1
    while size < elements.count {
        var index = elements.startIndex
        while index < elements.endIndex - size {
            let theoreticalFinalIndex = elements.index(index, offsetBy: 2*size - 1)
            let actualFinalIndex = theoreticalFinalIndex >= elements.endIndex ? elements.index(before: elements.endIndex) : theoreticalFinalIndex
            merge(array: &elements, loIndex: index, midIndex: index + size - 1, hiIndex: actualFinalIndex)

            index = elements.index(index, offsetBy: 2 * size)
        }

        size = size * 2
    }

    return elements
}
```
