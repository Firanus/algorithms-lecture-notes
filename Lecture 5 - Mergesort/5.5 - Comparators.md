# 5.5 - Comparators

Next, we're going to look at Comparators, which help us sort the same data using different sort keys, in a similar way to how you can sort your music library by title, artist, album, listen count etc.

## Natural and Alternate Orders

We've already used the `Comparable` interface to sort data. This is intended to sort data by its **natural order**.

The `Comparator` interface is instead intended to allow you to sort data by an **alternate** order. It has the contract:
```Java
public interface Comparator<Key> {
  int compare(Key v, Key w);
}
```

The keys used for this *must be a total order*.

For instance, if you were sorting strings, you could see the following different orders:
* **Natural Order** - `Now is the time`
* **Case Insensitive** - `is Now the time`
* **Spanish** - `café cafetero cuarto churro nube ñoño`
* **British Phone Bool** - `McKinley Macintosh`
* etc...

To use these comparators with the Java system sort, you would:
1. Create a `Comparator` object
2. Pass as second argument to `Arrays.sort()`:
    ```Java
    String[] a;
    ...
    Arrays.sort(a); //Natural order
    ...
    Arrays.sort(a, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
    ...
    Arrays.sort(a, Collator.getInstance(new Locale("es")));
    ...
    Arrays.sort(a, new BritishPhoneBoolOrder());
    ```
    
The key here is that you *decouple the definition of the data type from what it means to compare two items of that type.*

## Supporting `Comparator`

To support Comparators in our `sort` methods, all we have to do is pass a Comparator as a second object to our sort methods, and use it to do the comparison. For instance:

```Java
public class Insertion {
  public static void sort(Object[] a) {
    //for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
      for (int j = i; j > 0 && less(comparator, a[j], a[j-1]); j--) {
    //      exch(a, j, j-1)
    //  }
    //}
  }
  
  private static boolean less(Comparator c, Object v, Object w) {
    return c.compare(v, w) < 0;
  }

  private static void exch(Object[] a, int i, int j) {
    Object swap = a[i];
    //a[i] = a[j];
    //a[j] = swap;
  }
}
```

To implement a `Comparator`, we normally use nested classes. The following implements this:

```Java
public class Student {
  public static final Comparator<Student> BY_NAME = new ByName();
  public static final Comparator<Student> BY_Section = new BySection();
  private final String name;
  private final int section;
  ...
    
  private static class ByName implements Comparator<Student> {
    public int compare(Student v, Student w) {
      return v.name.compareTo(w.name);
    }
  }
  
  private static class BySection implements Comparator<Student> {
    public int compare(Student v, Student w) {
      return v.section - w.section;
    }
  }
}
```

We've actually come across this already in the context of the Graham scan algorithm, where we want to sort points by their polar angle.

(As an aside, we can do this by using either high school trigonometry, or more efficiently, by just checking if a point is counter-clockwise of another.)
