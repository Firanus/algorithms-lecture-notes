# 8.3 - Ordered Operations

We saw last note that when keys are `Comparable`, we can implement efficient  search. In this section, we'll also have a look at some useful client functionality that making keys `Comparable` gives to us.

Some such functions include:

* `min()` - What's the 'smallest' element?
* `max()` - What's the 'largest' element?
* `select(int k)` - What's the kth element?
* `keys(Key start, Key end)` - What're the keys in a given range?
* `floor(Key key)` - What's the element with the closest key lower than the supplied one?
* `ceiling(Key key)` - What's the element with the closest key greater than the supplied one?

Taking these functions into account, we can now define an API for an ordered symbol tablem which looks like:

```Java
public interface ST<Key extends Comparable<Key>, Value> {
  ST();                               //initialiser
  void put(Key key, Value val);       // Puts key value in table (remove key if value null)
  Value get(Key key);                 // Lookup value paired with key (null if key is absent)
  void delete(Key key);               // Remove key (and its value) from table
  boolean contains(Key key);          // Is there a value paired with this key?
  boolean isEmpty();                  // Is the table empty?
  int size();                         // How many ke-value pairs are stored in the table?
  
  Key min();                          // smallest key
  Key max();                          // largest key
  Key floor(Key key);                 // largest key less than or equal to key
  Key ceiling(Key key);               // smallest key greater than or equal to key
  int rank(Key key);                  // number of keys less than key
  Key select(int k);                  // key of rank k
  void deleteMin();                   // delete smallest key
  void deleteMax();                   // delete largest key
  int size(Key lo, Key hi);           // number of keys in range [lo...hi]
  Iterable<Key> keys(Key lo, Key hi); // Keys in range [lo...hi] in sorted order
  Iterable<Key> keys();               // All the keys in the table in sorted order
}

```

Normally, we avoid wide interfaces like the above because we can't guarantee that all methods can be implemented efficiently. With these operations, we can make that guarantee.

Going back to the elementary binary search implementation in the last note, we find that, in general, operations that require mutating the array remain O(N), while operations that search O(log N) (`select` is the exception, O(1)).

The main takeaway from all of these methods is that we need our Symbol Table to implement all operations efficiently. In the next note, we'll get a chance to see how we'd go about doing that.
