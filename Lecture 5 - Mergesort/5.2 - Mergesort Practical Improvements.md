# 5.2 - Mergesort Practical Improvements

There are a number of practical improvements we can make to our mergesort.

## Use insertion sort for small arrays

Merge sort is too complex to be realistically useful for small arrays, due to the memory overheads associated with recurrence. Furthermore, because of the naature of recurrence, we are guaranteed to have small subarrays of size 1,2 or 3.

To resolve this issue, we can simply use insertion sort for these small subarrays, when it is in fact an efficient algorithm. This is easily done via the following modification to the `sort` method:

```Java
private static void sort(Comparable[] a, Comparable[] aux, int lo, int hi) {
    if (hi <= lo + CUTOFF - 1) {
      Insertion.sort(a, lo, hi);
      return;
    }
    // int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    // sort (a, aux, lo, mid);
    // sort (a, aux, mid + 1, hi);
    // merge(a, aux, lo, mid, hi);
}
```

A common cutoff for insertion sort is about 7 items.

## Stop if already sorted

This is another simple one. If our two subarrays are already in the right order, then we don't have any work to do (because we're indexing into an array, we don't even have to copy them). To implement this, all we have to do is add a test to see if the highest item of the left-hand array is lower than the lowest item of the right-hand array:

```Java
private static void sort(Comparable[] a, Comparable[] aux, int lo, int hi) {
    // if (hi <= lo) return;     
    // int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    // sort (a, aux, lo, mid);
    // sort (a, aux, mid + 1, hi);
    if (!less(a[mid+1], a[mid])) return;
    // merge(a, aux, lo, mid, hi);
}
```

## Eliminate the copy into the auxiliary array

We don't actually need to copy items into the auxiliary array at the beginning of our `merge` method; we can eliminate it by swapping the role of the auxiliary and the input array in each recursive call (Note that it's a bit mindbending proving this to yourself, but it remains true):

```Java
public static void merge(Comparable[] a, Comparable[] aux, int lo, int mid, int hi) { 
  // Removed copy
  
  // int i = lo, j = mid+1;
    
  // for (int k = 0; k <= hi; k++) {
  //   if      (i > mid)              a[k] = aux[j++];
  //   else if (j > hi)               a[k] = aux[i++];
  //   else if (less(aux[j], aux[i])) a[k] = aux[j++];
  //   else                           a[k] = aux[i++];
  // }
}
  
private static void sort(Comparable[] a, Comparable[] aux, int lo, int hi) {
  // if (hi <= lo) return;
  // int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
  sort (aux, a, lo, mid);
  sort (aux, a, mid + 1, hi);
  merge(a, aux, lo, mid, hi);
}
```
