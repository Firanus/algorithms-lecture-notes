# 3.2 - Queues

Queues are very similar to Stacks, the only difference is that when you remove an item from the queue, it is the item that was *least* recently added.

An example interface for a queue would look like:

```Java
public interface StringQueue {
  StringQueue();
  void enqueue(String item);
  String dequeue();
  boolean isEmpty();
  //optional
  int size();
}
```

You'll notice it is exactly the same interface as we had for stacks, just with different names.

## Linked List Implementations

To implement a queue with LinkedLists effectively, we need to maintain two pointers, one to the `first` item, and one to the `last` item. Otherwise this is very similar to the implementation we had for stacks.

```Java
public class LinkedStringQueue {
  private Node first;
  private Node last;

  private class Node {
    String item;
    Node next;
  }
  
  void enqueue(String item) {
    Node newLast = new Node();
    newLast.item = item;
    newLast.next = null;
    if (isEmpty()) { // special case for empty queue
      first = newLast;
    } else {
      last.next = newLast;
    }
    last = newLast;
  }
  
  String dequeue() {
    String returnItem = first.item;
    first = first.next;
    if(isEmpty()) { //special case for empty queue
      last = null;
    }
    return returnItem;
  }
  
  boolean isEmpty() {
    return first == null;
  }
}
```

## Array Implementation

The array-based implementation of queues is actually a little trickier than one might first think. Again, we maintain a pointer to the `head` and the `tail` and add and remove appropriately.

The trick is that when your array indices advance far enough down the array, you eventually have to start setting them to 0 again. In addition, we of course need to implement the resizing capability. We'll leave the coding of this as an exercise to the reader.
