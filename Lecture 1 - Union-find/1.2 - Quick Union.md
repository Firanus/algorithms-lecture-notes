# 1.2 Quick Union

So quick find is too slow. Let's try a new algorithm called quick union that demonstrates the lazy approach to algorithm design (where you avoid doing work til you have to)

Our data structure is again an array of size N. Now however, we interpret the array differently, as a tree. Now, id[i] is the parent of i. So for instance in the following array:

[0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4]

we have 3 seperate little trees. The node 0 sits on its own and has no branches. The node 1 is the parent of node 2, and the nodes 3-6 are all part of a little tree, where 3 is the root node, 4 and 5 are its children, and 6 is a child of 4.

Let's code it up:

```Java
public class QuickUnionUF
{
  private int[] id;
  
  public QuickUnionUF(int N)
  {
    id = new int[N];
    for (int i = 0; i<N; i++)
      id[i] = i;
  }
  
  public boolean find(int p, int q) 
  {
    return root(p) == root(q)
  }
  
  public void union(int p, int q)
  {
    id[root(p)] = root(q);
  }
  
  private int root(int p)
  {
    return id[p] == p ? p : root(id[p]);
  }
}
```

Now how are we doing complexity wise? Both operations call findRootOfTree. What is the complexity of that? Well, we iterate up the tree, but the worst case scenario is that we have to iterate through the entire tree. So now all 3 of our public methods are complexity N.

## Comparing Complexities

What were the deficiencies of our two methods?

### Quick-Find
* Union too expensive (N array accesses)
* Trees are flat, but its expensive to keep them flat.

### Quick-Union
* Trees are too tall
* Find is potentially too expensive (can be up to N array accesses)
