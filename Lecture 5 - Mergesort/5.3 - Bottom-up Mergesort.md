# 5.3 - Bottom-up Mergesort

While mergesort is perhaps most easily understood as a recusive algorithm, there is also a bottom-up version of it that is both relatively easy to understand and to code.

## Algorithm

The basic permise of the algorithm is to pass through the array merging subarrays of size 1. You then repeat for subarrays of size 2, 4, 8, 16, etc...

The main differencce here is the lack of recursion.

The code is:

```Java
public class MergeBU {
  public static Comparable[] aux;
  
  public static void sort(Comparable[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    
    aux = new Comparable[N]l;
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) aux[j] = a[j];
    
    
    for (int size = 1; size < N; size *= 2) {
      for (int lo = 0; lo < N - size; lo += size + size)
        merge(a, lo, lo+sz-1, Math.min(lo+sz+sz-1, N-1));
      }
    }
  }
  
  private static void merge(Comparable[] a, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
    /*As before*/
  }
}
```

This is concise, industrial strength code. The only downside is, as with regular mergesort, you need N additional space.
