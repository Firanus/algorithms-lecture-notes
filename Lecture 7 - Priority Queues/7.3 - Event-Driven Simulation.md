# 7.3 - Event-Driven Simulation

In this section we'll look at an interesting application of priority queues called event-driven simulation.

## Simulation

Our goal here is to perform a simulation of the natural world, as is found extremely often in science. (Hell, it's the first programming I ever did).

In particular:

> **Goal**: Simulate the motion of N moving particles that behave according to the laws of elastic collision.

(Aside: This exact problem was one of the first things I ever programmed duting my degree. Funny old world we live in. :P Having said that, didn't do it using priority queues)

### Hard-disk model

The model we will use for our particles is the **hard-disk model**. This states:
* Moving particles interact via elastic collisions with each other and the walls
* Each particle is a disc with known position, velocity, mass and radius
* There are no other forces.

This is of significance in physics because we can relate macroscopic obervables like temperature and pressure to microscopic particle dynamics. Two interesting cases include:
* The **Maxwell-Boltzmann** distribution of speeds as a function of temperature.
* The **Brownian motion** of pollen grains, as first explained by Einstein

### No-Collision implementation

To start us off, here is the code for a simple client to simulate the movement of balls in a unit square without any collision.

```Java
public class BouncingBalls {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int N = Interger.parseInt(args[0]);
    
    Ball[] balls = new Ball[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      balls[i] = new Ball(); //Ball randomly sets params
    
    // main simulation loop
    while(true) {
      StdDraw.clear();
      for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        balls[i].move(0.5);
        balls[i].draw();
      }
      StdDraw.show(50); //shows for 50 ms
    }
  }
}
```
```Java
public class Ball {
  private double rx, ry;        //position
  private double vx; vy;        //velocity
  private final double radius;  //radius
  public Ball() {
    /* Initialise position and velocity*/
  }
  
  public void move(double dt) {
    // handles collision with the walls of the unit square
    if ((rx + vx*dt < radius) || rx + vx*dt > 1.0 - radius) {
      vx = -vx;
    }
    if ((ry + vy*dt < radius) || ry + vy*dt > 1.0 - radius) {
      vy = -vy;
    }
    
    // update position
    rx = rx + vx*dt;
    ry = ry + vy*dt;
  }
  
  public void draw() {
    StdDraw.filledCircle(rx, ry, radius);
  }
}
```

## Introducing Collisions

There are a couple of things we need to work out in order to be able to introduce collisions between the balls:

1. What happens when the balls collide? (Physics)
2. What objects checks for the collisions? How do we avoid doing too many checks? (Computer Science)

There are a couple of approaches we can take to try to solve these problems.

### Time-driven simulation

In this implementation (which is what I did in uni all that time ago), we discretize our time into quanta of size `dt`.

At each step, we update the position for each of our particles after every `dt` units of time, and check for overlaps with other particles.

In the case of an overlap, you roll back the clock to the time of the collision, update the velocities of the colliding particles appropriately, and continue the simulation.

### Main drawbacks

Unfortunately, there are a number of drawbacks to implementing this method:

* You have to do `~N^2/2` overlap checks every time quantum
* If `dt` is very small, your simulation will be very slow
* If `dt` is too large, you can miss collisions (balls can pass over each other in between your checks).

### Event-driven simulation

In this form of simulation, we only change state when something happens. In our case that means:
* Between collisions, particles move in straight-line trajectories
* Focus onnly on times when collisions occur
* Maintain a priority queue of collision events, prioritized by time.
* Remove the minimum = getting the next collision

In this form of simulation, we have 2 main phases:

1. **Prediction** (at time `t`) - The particles hit unless one passes an intersection point before the other arrives
2. **Resolution** (at time `t + dt`) - The velocities of both particles change after the collision.

For this to work, we need to be able to work out when the particles will collide, and how to resolve a collision. Both of these problems are well-understood physics problems, so we won't go into much depth with them here now. We'll just use the results.

## The Physics

To do an event-driven simulation, we'll need to extend our class `Ball`:

```Java
public class Ball {
  private double rx, ry;        //position
  private double vx; vy;        //velocity
  private final double radius;  //radius
  private final double mass;    //mass
  private int count;            //number of collisions
  
  public Particle(...) { }
  
  public void move(double dt) { }
  public void draw() { }
  
  // prediction methods
  public double timeToHit(Particle that)  { }
  public double timeToHitVerticalWall()   { }
  public double timeToHitHorizontalWall() { }
  
  // resolution methods
  public void bounceOff(Particle that)  { }
  public void bounceOffVerticalWall()   { }
  public void bounceOffHorizontalWall() { }
}
```
The actual implementations involve the aforementioned physics. Don't worry about it if that's the case.

## Simulation Main Loop

To initialize our main loop, we need to:
* Fill the PQ with all potential particle-wall collisions (linear time)
* Fill the PQ with all potential particle-particle collisions (quadratic time - that's life!)

We say 'potential' collisions because a previous collision can invalidate a future one. We'll need to handle this in our main loop. With that in mind, we can sketch out our main loop:

* Delete the impending event from PQ (min priority = `t`)
* If the event has been invalidated, ignore it
* Advance all particles to time `t`, on a straight-line trajectory
* Update the velocities of the colliding particles
* Predict future particle-wall and particle-particle collisions involving the colliding particles and insert events onto the PQ. (linear number of predictions, hence this phase takes linearithmic time).

### Event data type

We'll introduce a data type to handle our events, and take up a few conventions to simplify our code:
* Neither particle `null` => particle-particle collision
* One particle `null` => particle-wall event
* Both particles `null` => redraw event

```Java
private class Event implements Comparable<Event> {
  private double time;        // time of event
  private Particle a, b;      // particles involved
  private int countA, countB; // collision counts for a and b
  
  public Event(doublt t, Particle a, Particle b) { }
  
  // order by time
  public int compareTo(Event that) {
    return this.time - that.time;
  }
  
  // invalid if intervening collision
  public boolean isValid() { }
}
```

### Collision System Skeleton

We can sketch out a skeleton of our Collision System now:

```Java
public class CollisionSystem {
  private MinPQ<Event> pq;
  private double t = 0.0;
  private Particle[] particles;
  
  public CollisionSystem(Particle[] particles) { }
  
  // This method predicts all collisions for 1 particle
  private void predict(Particle a) {
    if (a == null) return;
    
    //paricle-particle collisions
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      double dt = a.timeToHit(particles[i]);
      pq.insert(new Event(t + dt, a, particles[i]));
    }
    
    // particle-wall collisions
    pq.insert(new Event(t + a.timeToHitVerticalWall(), a, null));
    pq.insert(new Event(t + a.timeToHitHorizontalWall(), null, a));
  }
  
  private void redraw() { }
  
  public void simulate() { } // see below
}
```

### Main Loop

```Java
public void simulate() {
  
  // starting up
  pq = new MinPQ<Event>();
  for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) predict(particles[i]);
  pq.insert(new Event(0, null, null));
  
  while(!pq.isEmpty()) {
    Event event = pq.delMin();
    if(!event.isValid()) continue; //skip invalid events
    Particle a = event.a;
    Particle b = event.b;
    
    // update positions and times
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
      particles[i].move(event.time - t);
    t = event.time;
    
    // process the event
    if      (a != null && b != null) a.bounceOff(b);
    else if (a != null && b == null) a.bounceOffVerticalWall();
    else if (a == null && b != null) a.bounceOffHorizontalWall();
    else if (a == null && b == null) redraw();
    
    // predict new events
    predict(a);
    predict(b);
  }
}
```

Using this code, we can simulate a huge variety of physical phenomena, ranging from browning motion, to diffusion of gases, to balls on a billiard table. This is part of the reason such applications of computing are proving so vital to the sciences nowadays.
