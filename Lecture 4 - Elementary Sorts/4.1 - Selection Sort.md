# 4.1 - Selection Sort

The first sorting method we'll have a look at is the selection sort.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm for this method is very simple:
1. Initialise an index i = 0;
2. Go through the array from index i to the end and find the smallest remaining entry (e.g. at index min).
3. Swap a[i] and a[min]
4. Increment i
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until i == array.length

### Invariants

It can sometimes help to think of algorithms in terms of **invariants**. In the selection sort algorithm:
* Everything item with an index less than i is fixed, and in ascending order. *
* No item with an index greater than i is smaller than an entry with an index less than i.

To implement the algorithm, all we do is increment i, and then do any work necessary to maintain the invariants. This immediately gives us our code for the selection sort implementation:

```Java
public class Selection {
  
  public static void sort(Comparable[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      int min = i;
      for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++) {
        if (less(a[j], a[min])) {
          min = j;
        }
      }
      exch(a, i, min);
    }
  }
  
  //less implementation from before
  //exch implementation from before
}
```

## Complexity

Just by looking at the implementation it is easy to guess the complexity; you have two nested for loops, so you're likely to have O(N^2).

Doing our analysis more thoroughly, we can see in our implementation that in each loop we do N-i-1 comparisons. Thus, the total number of comparisons is the sum from 0 to N-1 ~ N^2/2. In addition, we also do N exchanges.

Thus, our **time complexity** is **~ N^2 / 2** (which confirms our earlier guess of O(N^2))

We can also see that our implementation does all our rearrangement in-place, thus our **space complexity** is **O(1)**

We also note that the **running time is insensitive to the input**, and that it does the **minimum amount of data movement**
