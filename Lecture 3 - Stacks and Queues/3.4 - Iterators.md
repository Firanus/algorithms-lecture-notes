# 3.4 - Iterators

Another facility that Java allows that will significantly improve our client code is **iteration**.

What we want is to allow clients to iterate over the items in a stack (and a queue), without revealing its internal implementation details, for example in a `for` or a `foreach` loop.

In Java, we do this by making Stack implement the `Iterable` interface.

## `Iterable`

An `Iterable` class is a method that returns an `Iterator`. What is an iterator, it is an object that has the methods `hasNext()` and `next()` (and also optionally `remove()`, though this is dangerous).

The code to do the implementation (minus the throwing of exceptions) is:

```Java
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Stack<Item> implements Iterable<Item> {
  ...
    
  public Iterator<item> iterator() {
    return new ListIterator();
  }
  
  private class ListIterator implements Iterator<Item> {
    private Node current = first;
    
    public boolean hasNext() { return current != null; }
    public void remove() { /* Not supported, throw NoSuchOperationException */ }
    public Item next() {
      //We should throw a NoSuchElementException if there isn't an element
      Item item = current.item;
      current = current.next;
      return item;
    }
  }
}
```

For an array, our implementation is even easier:

```Java
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Stack<Item> implements Iterable<Item> {
  ...
    
  public Iterator<item> iterator() {
    return new ReverseArrayIterator();
  }
  
  private class ReverseArrayIterator implements Iterator<Item> {
    private int i = N;
    
    public boolean hasNext() { return i > 0; }
    public void remove() { /* Not supported */ }
    public Item next() { return s[--i]; }
  }
}

```

## Bags

For a lot of collections, we actually don't even care about the order we're adding. We jsut want to be able to add and iterate. The interface for that class looks like:

```Java
public interface Bag<Item> implements Iterable<Item> {
  Bag();
  void add(Item x);
  int size();
  Iterable<Item> iterator();
}
```

Implementing this is just a matter of implementing stack without the pop or queue without the dequeue.
